# AI Medical Diagnostic Assistant

## Overview

The AI Medical Diagnostic Assistant is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to analyze patient medical data and provide evidence-based diagnostic insights. The system processes various medical data formats (CSV, JSON, text) and generates differential diagnoses with confidence scores, along with clinical recommendations and red flag warnings. The application serves as a clinical decision support tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnostic workflows.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web application with custom CSS styling
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar for data input and configuration
- **Visualization**: Plotly integration for interactive medical charts and data visualization
- **UI Components**: Modular design with specialized medical interface components including alert systems for urgent, warning, and success notifications

### Backend Architecture
- **Core Engine**: Modular Python architecture with three main components:
  - `DiagnosticEngine`: Handles AI-powered medical analysis using OpenAI GPT-5
  - `DataProcessor`: Manages medical data ingestion, standardization, and field mapping
  - `UIComponents`: Provides reusable interface elements and visualization tools
- **Data Processing**: Smart field mapping system that standardizes various medical data formats into consistent structures
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration with structured JSON response formatting for consistent diagnostic output

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Input Formats**: Support for CSV, JSON, and text file uploads
- **Field Mapping**: Automatic detection and mapping of medical fields (demographics, vital signs, symptoms, lab results, imaging, clinical notes)
- **Data Standardization**: Converts disparate data formats into unified patient data structures for AI analysis

### Diagnostic Workflow
- **AI Model**: Uses OpenAI GPT-5 for medical analysis with low temperature settings (0.2) for consistent, reliable outputs
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized system prompts designed for medical diagnostic scenarios
- **Output Structure**: Structured JSON responses including differential diagnoses, confidence scores, clinical recommendations, and red flag warnings
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable confidence thresholds, maximum diagnosis counts, and red flag inclusion options
