🧠 AI-Powered Diagnostic & Triage Support System
📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to support clinicians in diagnostics and triage. It integrates patient data (history, vitals, labs, imaging, and notes), generates ranked diagnoses with confidence scores, detects urgent red-flag conditions, and produces structured, explainable reports.

Built for the AgenticSprint Hackathon, the system emphasizes explainability, security, and clinician-friendly workflows.
