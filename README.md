# 🧠 AI-Powered Diagnostic & Triage Support System

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to support clinicians in diagnostics and triage. It integrates patient data, including history, vitals, labs, imaging, and notes, to generate ranked diagnoses with confidence scores, detect urgent red-flag conditions, and produce structured, explainable reports.  

Built for the **AgenticSprint Hackathon**, the system emphasizes **explainability**, **security**, and **clinician-friendly workflows**.

  Consolidates patient history, labs, vitals, imaging, and clinical notes into a unified view.

- **🧠 AI Diagnosis Generation**  
  Leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide ranked diagnoses along with reasoning and confidence scores.

- **🚨 Red-Flag Detection**  
  Detects urgent cases, including sepsis, stroke, and cardiac events, for immediate attention.

- **📊 Interactive Dashboards**  
  Clinician-facing reports and visualizations for easy interpretation and decision support.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system architecture includes:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer** – Collects patient history, vitals, labs, imaging, and notes.  
2. **AI Diagnosis Engine** – Processes data using LLMs to generate ranked diagnoses with confidence scores.  
3. **Red-Flag Module** – Monitors for urgent medical conditions and flags high-priority cases.  
4. **Reporting & Visualization Layer** – Produces interactive, clinician-friendly dashboards and reports.  
5. **Security Layer** – Ensures data privacy, secure access, and regulatory compliance.
